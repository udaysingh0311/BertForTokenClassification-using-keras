# BertForTokenClassification-using-keras
This repository contains code for a Named Entity Recognition (NER) task using the BERT model. The code is written in Python and uses the TensorFlow and Transformers libraries.

The main functionality of the code is to preprocess the training and test data, tokenize the text using the BERT tokenizer, and train a BERT model for NER. The preprocessed data is grouped by sentence, and the BERT model is fine-tuned on this data to predict the NER tags for each token in a sentence.
